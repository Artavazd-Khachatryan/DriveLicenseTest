# APP_ROADMAP — Driving License Test App

> Living document. Update status after completing each step.

---

## Phase 1: Wire Real Data & Fix Foundations

The app has DB models and UI but they aren't connected. Fix this first — everything else builds on it.

- **1.1 Persist test results** — Save `TestSession` and `QuestionAttempt` to database when a test completes
- **1.2 Track question progress** — Update `QuestionWithProgress` (timesAnswered, timesCorrect, timesIncorrect) after each answer
- **1.3 Real stats on HomeScreen** — Replace hardcoded 70% with actual accuracy from DB; show real total questions answered, tests taken
- **1.4 Fix image loading** — Add fallback UI (placeholder icon) when question image is missing; handle errors gracefully instead of silent console logs

---

## Phase 2: Stats Screen & Review Mistakes

Users need to see their progress and learn from errors.

- **2.1 Build StatsScreen** — Overall accuracy ring, total attempts, correct/incorrect counts
- **2.2 Category breakdown** — Per-category accuracy with progress bars
- **2.4 Test history list** — Show past test sessions (date, score, pass/fail icon)
- **2.5 Review Mistakes screen** — Lists incorrectly answered questions with correct answer shown

---

## Phase 3: Practice Mode & Smart Selection

Move beyond random 20-question tests.

- **3.1 Practice by category** — Category picker screen with question counts; starts filtered test
- **3.3 Weak areas practice** — Pulls questions with most mistakes first via getWeakAreaQuestions()
- **3.4 Configurable test length** — Let user choose 10/20/30 questions before starting
- **3.5 Exam simulation mode** — 30 questions, 20-minute countdown timer, auto-submits on timeout

---

## Phase 4: Navigation & UX Polish

Replace fragile navigation and improve overall feel.

- **4.1 Type-safe navigation** — Sealed class `Screen` with back stack (`mutableStateListOf`)
- **4.2 Bottom navigation bar** — Home / Practice / Stats tabs via `AppBottomBar`, shown on top-level screens only
- **4.3 Transitions** — `AnimatedContent`: slide for stack push/pop, fade for tab switches
- **4.4 Back handling** — Exit confirmation dialog when tapping back during an active test
- **4.5 Use existing components** — `StatChip` wired into HomeScreen progress section

---

## Phase 5: Armenian Localization

The app targets Armenian users preparing for the driving exam.

- **5.1 Extract all strings** — Move hardcoded English text to string resources
- **5.2 Armenian translations** — Add Armenian (`hy`) translations for all UI strings
- **5.3 Armenian as default** — Set Armenian as primary language, English as fallback

---

## Phase 6: UI Refinements

Polish the look and feel.

- **6.1 Dark mode audit** — Fixed hardcoded Color.Red in timer; all other colors use colorScheme tokens
- **6.2 Long text handling** — Existing verticalScroll on detail screens handles long content; Text wraps naturally
- **6.3 Empty states** — Mistakes screen has illustrated empty card; Stats cards show inline empty messages
- **6.4 Loading states** — CircularProgressIndicator added to StatsScreen and ReviewMistakesScreen
- **6.5 Accessibility pass** — ProgressRing contentDescription; AnswerButton incorrect color fixed; home ring CD wired
- [x] **6.6 Tablet/landscape** — `AdaptiveContentContainer` (600dp+ expanded); Home start/progress side-by-side; question image beside text on wide screens; 720dp max width
- [x] **6.7 Motivating messages** — Context-aware encouragement on Home (streak, accuracy, first visit) and test results (score bands)
- [x] **6.8 UI polish (May 2026)** — Armenian string grammar, Material icons instead of emoji, staggered home animations, dynamic test-length subtitle, category string resources

---

## Phase 7: Crash Reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)

Capture crashes and non-fatal errors on **Android** and **iOS** so production issues are visible before users report them.

**Recommended stack:** [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics) (native SDK per platform; KMP bridge via `expect`/`actual`).

- [x] **7.1 Firebase project & apps** — Placeholder `google-services.json` + `GoogleService-Info.plist`; replace with real Firebase project (see `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`).
- [x] **7.2 Android Crashlytics** — Google Services + Crashlytics Gradle plugins on `androidApp`; Firebase BOM dependency.
- [x] **7.3 iOS Crashlytics** — GitLive Firebase SDK + `GoogleService-Info.plist` in iosApp bundle.
- [x] **7.4 Crash reporting API** — `CrashReporting` in `composeApp` (GitLive); initialized from `App.kt`.
- **7.5 Wire critical paths** — Report non-fatals for DB init failures, coroutine errors (optional follow-up).
- **7.6 Privacy & build flavors** — Document data collected; tune debug collection if needed.
- **7.7 Verification checklist** — Replace placeholder Firebase configs; force test crash; confirm in console.

**Out of scope for 7.x (optional later):** Analytics, Performance Monitoring, Remote Config, Sentry (unless we switch providers).

---

## Phase 8: Driving Schools (list only)

Help users find a physical driving school in Armenia — **list view only** (no in-app map).

- [x] **8.1 Curated school list** — Static list of well-known auto schools (Yerevan + regions) with name, city, address, phone, short description (`LearningCentersData`, `DrivingSchoolsScreen`).
- [x] **8.2 Full question coverage** — `QuestionSelector` prioritizes never-attempted questions before repeats so the user does not miss items in the bank.

**Out of scope:** Embedded map, dial/maps deep links, verified phone directory (not planned).

**Feature flag:** `AppFeatures.drivingSchoolsEnabled`

## Encouragement messages (current behavior)

Context-aware Armenian copy — **not** a chat bot; rules live in `MotivationLogic.kt` + `strings.xml`.

### Home (`homeMotivationMessage`)

| Condition | Message tone |
|-----------|----------------|
| No tests yet | Start your first test |
| Streak ≥ 7 days | Strong consistency praise |
| Streak ≥ 3 days | Growing streak encouragement |
| Accuracy ≥ 80% | High accuracy — well prepared |
| Accuracy ≥ 50% | Steady progress — keep practicing |
| Else | Every question counts — keep going |

### Test results (`testResultMotivationMessage`)

| Condition | Message tone |
|-----------|----------------|
| Passed, 100% | Perfect — ready for exam |
| Passed, ≥ 90% | Excellent — almost there |
| Passed | You passed — keep pace |
| Failed, ≥ 60% | Almost passed |
| Failed | Review mistakes and retry |

Shown on **Home** welcome card, **during a test** every 5 answered questions (inline banner on the question screen), and **Results** header (with pass/fail title). No push notifications for motivation yet.

### In-test milestone (`inTestMilestoneMotivation*`)

| When | Message tone (based on session accuracy so far) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| After 5, 10, 15… answers | Header: “X/Y questions”; body: strong / steady / keep going (≥80% / ≥50% / else) |
